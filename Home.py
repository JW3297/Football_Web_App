Only developed for the Premier League 23/24 season as of the minute, but plan to add more in due course. Current tools are as follows:
- **Player Profiles:** Compare a player's percentile rank to others playing in their position. 
- **Player Similarity:** Use PCA to find the most similar players. 
- **Match Analysis:** Match dashboards of games. 
- **Team Profiles:** Compare team performance.
